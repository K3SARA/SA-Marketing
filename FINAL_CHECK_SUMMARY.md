### 3. Critical Bug Verification

**Status:** ✅ ALL FIXED

#### Bug #1: Concurrent Payment Collection

- **Original Issue:** Two staff collecting from same bill simultaneously could cause lost payments
- **Root Cause:** Non-atomic database operations
- **Fix Applied:** IndexedDB atomic transactions with read-write isolation
- **Test Verification:** "concurrent collections on one bill keep correct balance" → PASSING ✅
- **Result:** ✅ VERIFIED FIXED

#### Bug #2: Floating-Point Math Errors

- **Original Issue:** 100.01 - 100.00 = 0.009999... not 0.01
- **Root Cause:** JavaScript IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic
- **Fix Applied:** Money utility uses cents-based arithmetic (integers)
- **Test Verification:** "cent rounding prevents tiny balance from showing due" → PASSING ✅
- **Result:** ✅ VERIFIED FIXED

#### Bug #3: Bill Number Duplication

- **Original Issue:** Two staff creating bills simultaneously get same bill number
- **Root Cause:** Non-atomic counter read-modify-write
- **Fix Applied:** Bill number generation within atomic transaction
- **Test Verification:** "concurrent bill creation assigns unique bill numbers" → PASSING ✅
- **Result:** ✅ VERIFIED FIXED

---

### 4. PWA & Offline Capabilities

**Status:** ✅ VERIFIED WORKING

**Service Worker:**

- ✅ sw.js installed with cache version 99
- ✅ All static assets cached

**Considerations:**
