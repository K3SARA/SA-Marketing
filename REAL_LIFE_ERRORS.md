# Critical Real-Life Errors Found in SA Marketing

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES (Will cause data loss or financial discrepancies)

### 1. **Race Condition: Concurrent Bill Collection on Shared Devices** ⚠️ MOST CRITICAL
**Location:** `collection.js` - `collectPayment()` function  
**Severity:** HIGH - Will cause double payments/collections

**Problem:**
- Even though the code fetches a "fresh" bill from DB before processing collection, if two devices/tabs try to collect from the same bill simultaneously, both could see the same balance before either completes the transaction.
- The validation happens AFTER fetching but BEFORE the atomic update, creating a window for race conditions.
- **Impact:** Customer can be charged twice for same amount, or underpayment can be recorded.

**Example Scenario:**
```
Bill Balance: LKR 1000
Device A reads balance = 1000
Device B reads balance = 1000
Device A collects 500 → Balance becomes 500
Device B collects 500 → Balance becomes 500 (WRONG! Should be 0)
Result: LKR 1000 collected but system shows LKR 500 remaining
```

**Current Code (Line in collection.js):**
```javascript
// Fetch fresh from DB
const bill = await window.db.getBillById(Number(billId));
// ... validation on balance ...
// RACE CONDITION WINDOW HERE
const balance = Math.max(0, total - received);
if (amount > balance) { alert(...); return; }
// By the time we reach here, another process might have updated the bill
```

### 2. **Floating-Point Math Errors in Payment Calculations** 🔴
**Location:** `billing.js`, `collection.js`, `history.js` - Multiple places  
**Severity:** HIGH - Financial calculations become inaccurate

**Problem:**
- JavaScript uses IEEE 754 floating-point arithmetic which causes rounding errors
- Money calculations like: `balance = total - received` can produce values like `999.9999999999999`
- This breaks comparisons and causes display errors

**Example:**
```javascript
const total = 100.01;
const received = 100;
const balance = total - received; // Result: 0.009999999999990905 instead of 0.01
if (balance <= 0) { /* NOT triggered! */ }
```

**Impact:** 
- Users see balance showing as "1.00" when system calculates it as "0.01"
- Collections might be rejected even when exact amount is paid
- Over thousands of transactions, significant discrepancies accumulate

**Code References:**
- [billing.js Line ~540](billing.js#L540): `const balance = Math.max(0, total - received);`
- [collection.js Line ~130](collection.js#L130): `const balance = Math.max(0, total - received);`

### 3. **Bill Number Counter Race Condition** 🔴
**Location:** `db.js` - `getNextBillNumber()` function  
**Severity:** HIGH - Duplicate bill numbers created

**Problem:**
- When two bills are created simultaneously (different tabs/browsers), both could receive the same bill number
- The counter increment is NOT atomic - read and write are separate operations
- No locking mechanism

**Current Code:**
```javascript
async getNextBillNumber() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    const req = store.get('bill_counter');
    let next = 1;
    req.onsuccess = () => {
      const current = Number(req.result?.value || 0);
      next = current + 1;  // ← RACE CONDITION: Another process might do same here
      store.put({ key: 'bill_counter', value: next });
    };
    tx.oncomplete = () => resolve(next);
  });
}
```

**Scenario:**
- Bill 100 is last bill number in system
- Tab A: Reads counter = 100, calculates next = 101
- Tab B: Reads counter = 100, calculates next = 101 (DUPLICATE!)
- Both create bills with number 101

**Impact:** Bills can't be uniquely identified, audit trail becomes compromised

---

### 4. **Customer Outstanding Balance Not Refreshed on Shared Devices** 🟠
**Location:** `billing.js` - `loadOutstandingDirectory()`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Wrong balance shown, collections allowed beyond actual balance

**Problem:**
- Outstanding balance snapshot loaded once during page initialization
- If another device collects payment, the first device still shows old balance
- User can collect more than the actual outstanding amount

**Current Flow:**
```
Device A loads page → Outstanding = LKR 10000 loaded in memory
Device B collects LKR 5000 → Database updated
Device A still sees Outstanding = LKR 10000
Device A collects LKR 10000 → Total collected = LKR 15000 (OVER-PAYMENT)
```

**Code Affected:**
- [billing.js Line ~75](billing.js#L75): Outstanding map loaded once and cached
- No automatic refresh on page visibility change

---

### 5. **Stock Can Go Negative (Silent Data Corruption)** 🔴
**Location:** `db.js` - Stock deduction logic  
**Severity:** HIGH - Inventory completely unreliable

**Problem:**
- While code attempts to validate stock via `validateStockDelta()`, there's no atomic transaction
- Stock is displayed as "max(0, stock)" but underlying database value could be negative
- If two bills deduct stock simultaneously from same product, both might succeed

**Scenario:**
```
Product: Cashew Packets, Stock = 10
Bill A: Deduct 7 packets
Bill B: Deduct 5 packets (simultaneous)
Both read stock = 10 before either updates
Both pass validation (7 ≤ 10, 5 ≤ 10)
Result: Stock = 10 - 7 = 3, then 3 - 5 = -2 (NEGATIVE!)
UI shows 0, but actual value is -2
```

**Impact:** Inventory reports are wrong, overbilling occurs, customers receive incomplete orders

---

### 6. **No Error Handling for IndexedDB Transaction Failures** 🟠
**Location:** Throughout `db.js`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Data loss possible

**Problem:**
- IndexedDB transactions can fail silently
- No retry mechanism
- User might think bill is saved, but transaction actually failed

**Example:**
```javascript
// User creates bill with 5 items
await window.db.saveBillWithStockAndCollectionLog({...});
// If transaction fails silently, user continues without knowing
// Bill not saved, but stock already deducted from view
```

---

### 7. **Cheque Payment Status Not Tracked Per-Payment Method** 🟠
**Location:** `billing.js` and `collection.js`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Reconciliation breaks

**Problem:**
- When multiple payment methods are used including cheques, the cheque status is stored at bill level, not per-payment
- Can't track which specific cheque hasn't cleared

**Issue:**
```javascript
// If a bill has:
// - Cash: LKR 5000
// - Cheque: LKR 3000
// Only ONE cheque status stored at bill level (pending/cleared/bounced)
// Can't track individual cheque status after partial clearance
```

---

### 8. **Customer Name Case-Sensitivity Edge Case** 🟡
**Location:** `db.js` - `addCustomer()`, `addProduct()`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Data integrity issue

**Problem:**
- Customer names stored as lowercase for DB: `normalizedName = String(name || '').trim().toLowerCase()`
- But displayed in original case
- Duplicate detection uses case-insensitive comparison
- Can create confusion: Database has "john smith" but UI shows "John Smith" and "JOHN SMITH"

---

### 9. **Bill Editing with Deleted Products Silently Fails** 🟠
**Location:** `billing.js` - `generateBill()` function  
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Silent failure, no error message

**Problem:**
- When editing a bill, if a product was deleted from inventory after the bill was created:
  - User can still edit the bill
  - But stock updates won't happen (product not found)
  - User thinks bill is updated, but stock wasn't deducted/returned

**Code:**
```javascript
if (!this.editBillId) {
  // Check inventory only for NEW bills
  const unmatchedItems = this.getUnmatchedInventoryItems(mappedItems);
  // ...
}
// For EDIT mode: No check - if product is deleted, no warning!
// Stock delta calculation fails silently
```

---

### 10. **Negative Quantity Silently Converted to 0.01** 🟡
**Location:** `billing.js` - `updateItem()`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM - User confusion

**Problem:**
- User types "-50" in quantity field
- Code converts to 0.01 without warning
- User doesn't realize input was rejected

**Code:**
```javascript
if (field === 'qty') {
  item.qty = Math.max(0.01, parseFloat(value) || 1);
  // No alert that negative value was rejected!
}
```

**Result:** User enters -50, system accepts 0.01, no feedback

---

### 11. **Products With Zero Price Allowed** 🟡
**Location:** `db.js` - `addProduct()`, `billing.js` - validation  
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Can create bills with no revenue

**Problem:**
- No validation that product price > 0
- User can create products with "Selling price = 0"
- Bills created with these products show total = 0, but items are delivered

---

### 12. **Backup Reminder Uses Client Timestamp (Can Be Wrong)** 🟡
**Location:** `app.js` - `updateBackupReminder()`  
**Severity:** LOW - Backup might not be prompted when needed

**Problem:**
- Backup time stored as `Date.now()` (client time)
- User can manually set device time backward to skip backup reminders
- Or user travels across timezones and reminder gets confused

---

### 13. **No Concurrency Control for Bill Updates** 🔴
**Location:** `db.js` - `updateBillWithStockAndCollectionLog()`  
**Severity:** HIGH - Can lose collections

**Problem:**
- When two collection payments attempt on same bill:
  1. Transaction A: reads bill, adds payment, updates receivedAmount
  2. Transaction B: reads bill (OLD DATA), adds payment, updates receivedAmount
  3. Transaction B overwrites Transaction A's changes
- Result: Payment from A is lost

---

### 14. **Split Payment Validation Incomplete** 🟡
**Location:** `billing.js` - `validatePaymentRows()`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM - Invalid bills can be created

**Problem:**
```javascript
validatePaymentRows(payments) {
  for (const payment of payments) {
    if (this.isSplitPaymentActive() && payment.amount <= 0) {
      alert('Each payment amount must be more than 0.');
      return false;
    }
    // What if total payments don't equal bill total?
    // No validation for: sum(payments) == total
  }
  return true;
}
```

- Multiple payment rows might not sum to total
- User could create: Cash 500 + Card 300 for a LKR 1000 bill
- LKR 200 remains uncollected but no warning
