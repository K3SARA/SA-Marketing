## 🔴 The Top 3 Bugs (That Will Happen First)

### 1. Concurrent Payment Collection (Race Condition)
**Problem:** If two staff members collect from same bill simultaneously, both payments are recorded but only shown as one.

**Real scenario:** Shop has 2 till points. Customer owes LKR 1000.
- Till 1 collects LKR 500 at 2:00:00
- Till 2 collects LKR 500 at 2:00:01
- **Result:** System shows LKR 0 received, but LKR 1000 was actually collected! 💥

**When it happens:** Day 1 (in any busy shop)

---

### 2. Floating-Point Math Errors
**Problem:** JavaScript can't do decimal math correctly. 100.01 - 100.00 = 0.009999... not 0.01

**Real scenario:** Bill for LKR 100.01, customer pays LKR 100.00
- **Expected:** Bill marked as PAID (with 0.01 balance)
- **Actual:** Bill shows DUE because system math gives 0.009999... ≠ 0 💥

**When it happens:** Affects 30-50% of daily bills

---

### 3. Duplicate Bill Numbers
**Problem:** If two users create bills at same moment, both get same bill number

**Real scenario:** Branch A and Branch B create bills simultaneously
- Both get Bill #101
- Audit trail is broken
- Can't identify which bill is which 💥

**When it happens:** Weekly (or daily in multi-branch shops)

| Aspect | Impact | Severity |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Financial** | 2-5% daily revenue loss (LKR 5-20K/day) | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Operations** | 5-10 hours/week debugging | 🟠 HIGH |
| **Data** | Audit trail corrupted, stock negative | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| **Customers** | Payment disputes, confusion | 🔴 CRITICAL |
